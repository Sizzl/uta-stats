====================================
1. UTStats Actor Install Information
====================================

From the System folder in the zip file, copy to your UTServer\System folder the
following files:

UTSAccuBeta4_2.u
UTStatsBeta4_2.u

Remove any previous entries for UTStats and UTSAccuBeta from [Engine.GameEngine]

Add to [Engine.GameEngine] the following lines:
ServerActors=UTStatsBeta4_2.UTStatsSA
ServerPackages=UTSAccuBeta4_2

Under the [Engine.GameInfo] check for:
bLocalLog=True or bLocalLog=False

This line HAS to be:
bLocalLog=False

Setting it to True will not give you complete logs (don't ask why it just won't).

Log files are recorded to the UTServer\Logs folder.


==================================
2. UTStats Web Install Information
==================================

Note: If you already have the uts_country table from a previous version already 
in your database do not wipe it.
During the install instructions just ignore the bit that tells you to upload it.


UPGRADING:
Firstly we don't advise using any old logs, you will not benefit from any new 
features AND it will likely mess up some page data.
We apologise for not being able to save this information but there are a 
massive amount of new features that are well worth ditching the old logs for :)

If you do wish to keep the old logs you need to do a full install anyway, so 
drop all the tables (except uts_ip2country) you had and remove all the 
files/folders (making sure you don't delete the logs backups).
When you edit config.php make sure to change the option:
$import_incompatible_logs=false;
to 
$import_incompatible_logs=true;

If you are wisely going to ditch the old logs just clear out your old install 
and all the tables (except uts_ip2country) and start from here.


FULL INSTALL:
From the html folder in the zip file, upload all the files to your webserver 
wherever you like.  I suggest under a folder called utstats.
After the files have uploaded browse to the stats folder where you should see 
the following folders:

\images
\import
\includes
\logs
\pages

Using whatever means (usually the ftp client) you need to CHMOD the logs folder 
to 777.
Now go into the logs folder.
Now CHMOD the backups folder to 777.
Also CHMOD the utdc folder to 777.

Now go back a level and into the includes folder.
CHMOD the file ftptimestamp.php to 777.
Now edit the config.php file.

Enter in your mysql database, hostname, username and password at the top.
You must set an adminkey in here or you won't be able to import/use the admin 
feature.
Check all the other options to see if they are as you wish (they are set to 
what we consider the best options).
If you are going to use ftp transferring of log files amend the FTP connection 
as required.

Now import the contents of utstats.sql located under the sql folder into the 
database you entered into the config.php.
This will setup the following tables in your database:

uts_games
uts_gamestype
uts_ip2country
uts_killsmatrix
uts_match
uts_pinfo
uts_player
uts_rank
uts_weapons
uts_weaponstats

When you try to import utstats it will not drop the tables for you, it will 
just try to create them.
If you already have them it will fail and its up to you to drop them tables.

If you wish to use the country flags option you will need to install the sql 
files uts_ip2country1.sql to uts_ip2country7.sql
This MUST be done before you import your logs.



=================
3. Importing Logs
=================

Depending on the level of access you have and how competent you are you can do 
this 5 ways.
*** Important *** 
Make sure you edit config.php and set an adminkey at the top!

Way 1:
Use the included server mutator by +++crowbar+++ (can be found under addons)

Way 2:
If you don't have ftp access to your UT server or allowed to use ftp via php 
then upload your logs manually to the logs folder and then run the importer via 
the Import link.

Way 3:
If you have ftp access and can do ftp via php, edit the config.php file and 
input your UT servers ftp information into there.
Now run the importer via the Import link.

Way 4:
Automate the process using a cron job or scheduled task.
Just get this to run cd to the root of stats (where import.php is) and execute 
the import.php file with php.

Way 5:
Automate the web process using a web service cron job.
