I Want to Help What Can I Do?

When the Beta is released please check the pages.
They might be able to be done more efficiently or other things could be added.
If you work something out, let us know, share, don't be one of the selfish people 
in life who keeps it to themselves.
Remember, the maps you likely play, the mods you use, someone shared them. 
If you can, now is your opportunity to share back.
